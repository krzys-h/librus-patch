librus-patch
============

Librus has disabled their [old app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.devcraft.edziennik) in favor of the [new one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.librus.synergiaDru2). I find the old version a lot more convenient to use (and as you can see by the reviews on Google Play I'm not the only one), so I hacked it to make it work with new API details.

You can make a patched version yourself by using the patch.sh script, or download prebuilt version at https://github.com/krzys-h/librus-patch/releases
